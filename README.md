# How many columns are in Bootstrap?

**You can use a maximum of 12 columns in a [Bootstrap grid system](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/layout/grid/).**

Bootstrapâ€™s grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content. Itâ€™s built with flexbox and is fully responsive. Below is an example and an in-depth explanation for how the grid system comes together.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md">
      One of three columns
    </div>
    <div class="col-md">
      One of three columns
    </div>
    <div class="col-md">
      One of three columns
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
